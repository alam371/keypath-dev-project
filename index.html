    <h1>Economics Fundamentals 101 üöÄ</h1>
    <p>Demand and supply are possibly the two most fundamental concepts used in economics. The concept of market is usually defined as a number of buyers and sellers of a given good or service that are willing to negotiate in order to exchange those goods. We will first explain them separately and then jointly to show their interaction.</p>
    <p><span>Demand</span>: is the global market value that expresses the purchasing intentions of consumers. The demand curve shows the quantity of a specific product that individuals or society are willing to buy according to its price and their income. This curve shows an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded giving it a downward slope. The reason why this happens is known as the law of demand: ceteris paribus, and considering ordinary goods, the higher the price the lower the quantity demanded, and vice versa.</p>
    <p><span>Supply</span>: On the other side, supply is the set of offers made in the market for the sale of goods and services. The supply curve records the location of the points corresponding to the amount offered for a particular good or service at the different prices. This curve shows a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied, giving it an upward slope. The reason why this happens is known as the law of supply: ceteris paribus, and considering ordinary goods, the higher the price the higher the quantity supplied, and vice versa.</p>

      <h2>Equilibrium and market clearing ‚öñÔ∏è</h2>
      <p>The demand and supply curves define the market clearing, that is, where the demand of the products meets its supply. At this point we have what is known as, an equilibrium point, with its corresponding price and quantity of equilibrium.

        It is possible for disequilibrium to occur when the amount demanded does not equal the amount supplied. There are a series of scenarios in which this can happen. In situations in which the quantity demanded is higher than the quantity supplied, the market is suffering from an excess demand. When the opposite occurs we will be talking about an excess supply. Prices will have to gradually adjust through different market mechanisms until the equilibrium price is met.</p>
